# STN Data Transformation Repository

This repository provides tools for transforming and preparing data generated by the [irace-with-trajectories](https://github.com/Imperialdramon/irace-with-trajectories) framework for use with the [STNs-for-irace-v](https://github.com/Imperialdramon/STNs-for-irace-v) model. The main transformation functions are located in the `Transform_STN_Module` folder.

## Repository Structure

- **Transform_STN_Module/**: Contains all the core functions for data transformation and processing.
- **STN_files/**: Stores the resulting files that are ready to be used as input for the STN model.
- **trajectory_files/**: Contains the raw run data generated by irace executions with trajectories.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to process and convert the output data from irace runs (with trajectory tracking) into a format that is compatible and legible for the STN model used in the [STNs-for-irace-v](https://github.com/Imperialdramon/STNs-for-irace-v) repository.

## Data Source

The input data consists of execution results from [irace-with-trajectories](https://github.com/Imperialdramon/irace-with-trajectories), which is a modified version of irace 3.x that records detailed configuration trajectories during the tuning process.

## Usage

1. Place the raw trajectory files from irace runs into the `trajectory_files` directory.
2. Use the transformation functions in the `Transform_STN_Module` to process these files.
3. The processed, STN-compatible files will be output to the `STN_files` directory.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input data follows the format produced by the modified irace 3.x with trajectory support.
- The transformation scripts are tailored to the requirements of the STN model in the [STNs-for-irace-v](https://github.com/Imperialdramon/STNs-for-irace-v) repository.
